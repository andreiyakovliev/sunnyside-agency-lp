# Sunnyside Agency
My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Technologies:

HTML, CSS (SCSS), GULP.

Responsive design
